TITLE: Collision of the Lights

Description:
This scene displays a cornell box with a wall dividing two lights: Red (area lights) and Blue (point lights)
Here we can see chess pieces and spheres in the scene where the Queen is in the intersection of the two lights.
By this ensemble and collision of the lights, we get a combined magenta lights being refracted by the queen. 
Lastly, DOF blur is added on top to make a clearer focus on the beautiful glass-like chess queen.

The image contains the following extra features implemented:

1. Fresnel Reflection 
--> Easly observable on the sphere on the left

2. Refraction 
--> although the rook is blurred, you can see the checkerboard on the bottom is being refracted.
Also the queen has refraction which can be observed towards the base. but it also has reflection applied making a more distorted image

3. DOF blur
- The main focus is on the chess queen and the sphere on the left, leaving a fuzzy focus on the outer images.

4. Area Lights
- The red light in this scene is using area lights, where the Rook and sphere are displaying soft shadows. 
- Due to the DOF blur, the soft shadows and hard shadows (point light ray trace) are a bit difficult to observe, but you can see tell they are softer.
- I included a separate .png file to show a more clearer demonstration for this in the assignment submission

5. Path Tracing
- path tracing was implemented to create soft shadows as well as a more well-lit environment along with indirect lighting (color bleeding)
- The sphere on the right has some of the red light being bounced onto it. Due to the blur it is a bit subtle and hard to see...
- The scene could have had a clearer image (less noise) if I increased the sampling.
- But unfortunately, I could not do this as the image already took 92 hours to render... If I implemented TAICHI maybe it could have been faster

6. Acceleration using hierarchical bounding volumes (BVH)
- Last but not least, this scene's chess queen and rook piece meshes were rendered using BVH
- If it wasn't for this techinqiue, this image may never have seen the light of day because it would have taken longer than 92 hours
